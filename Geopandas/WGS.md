## World Geodetic System (WGS) 
> It is a standard used in cartography, geodesy, and satellite navigation including GPS.
> 
> The current version, **WGS 84**, defines an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system and a geodetic
> datum, and also describes the associated Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) and World Magnetic Model (WMM).
> The standard is published and maintained by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency

- **Geodesy** : the science of measuring and representing the geometry, gravity, and spatial orientation of
  the Earth in temporally varying 3D.  

- **Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinate system (ECEF)**, also known as the geocentric coordinate system, is
    a cartesian spatial reference system that represents locations in the vicinity of the Earth (including its
    surface,interior, atmosphere, and surrounding outer space) as X, Y, and Z measurements from its center of
    mass.  

  - **A geodetic datum** it is a global datum reference for precisely representing the position of
    locations on Earth or other planetary bodies by means of geodetic coordinates.  

  - **datum reference** is some important part of an object—such as a point,line, plane, hole, set of holes,
    or pair of surfaces—that serves as a reference in defining the geometry of the object and (often) in
    measuring aspects of the actual geometry to assess how closely they match with the nominal value,
    which may be an ideal, standard, average, or desired value.
