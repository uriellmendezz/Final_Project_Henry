- GeoPandas is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier
- GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.
- Geometric operations are performed by shapely.
> Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects.
---
> (Berkeley Software Distribution) license: BSD-licensed Python packages are popular in the Python ecosystem because they strike a balance between permissiveness and providing some level of protection for the original developers' rights and attribution.

- Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and matplotlib for plotting.
> Fiona: is a popular Python library used for reading and writing geographic vector data files. It provides a simple and efficient way to work with various geospatial file formats, such as Shapefiles (SHP), GeoJSON, and others. Fiona is commonly used in geospatial data processing, analysis, and visualization tasks.
