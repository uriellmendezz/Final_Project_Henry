## Metropolitan Transportation Authority 

It is North America's largest transportation network, serving a population of 
15.3 million people across a 5,000-square-mile travel area surrounding New York City, Long Island, southeastern New York State, 
and Connecticut. The MTA network comprises the nation’s largest bus fleet and more subway and commuter rail cars than all other 
U.S. transit systems combined.

We are committed to maintaining a transit system that is safe, reliable, and accessible for all. We’re investing in systemwide 
improvements that will keep our transit system running smoothly for decades to come. And we’re continuously working on ways to 
improve our own operations in ways that support our core values of equity, accessibility, sustainability, and 
cost-consciousness.
